    <header id="noted">Hello, my name is Andrew but nerds know me as Clampers 😊</header>

    <p>I am a professional food critic (yes, someone pays me to do it).
        I've reviewed all kinds of foods, but my favorite food is fish!</p>

    <p>I'm going to tell you about all my favorite kinds of fish
        and where they come from along with their Japanaese name 
        because I'm weeby like that.</p>

    <p>Let's dig in. YUM!</p>

        <h1>🐟Mackerel</h1>
        <h3>Saba</h3>

        <p>Mackerel can be found all over the world, but the "true Mackerel" in the tribe
            Scrombrini is native to the Atlantic. A noteworthy sliver of silver is found
            on the meat when served raw. It tastes a lot like the way people say fish smells!

        <h3>Sake</h3>
        <img src="https://www.littlemadfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SALMON.jpg" />
        <p>Looked down upon by Japanese sushi afficiandos, it is none the less
            tasty and plentiful being found in various forms in both fresh and salt
            water. Orangey pink and fatty, it is ubiquitos in American restaurants.

        <h1>🐟Yellowfin Tuna</h1>
        <h3>Kihara</h3>

        <p>Often marketed as "Ahi <span class="tuna">tuna</span>", this meaty <span class="tuna">tuna</span> can be found in the tropical Atlantic
            and off islands in both the Western and Easter Pacific. Noted for its bright
            pink flesh and toothsome bite, it is often prepared seared but I prefer it
            like I prefer all fish... raw!

        <h1>🐟Escolar</h1>
        <h3>Abura Bozu</h3>
        <img src="http://matsuri.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/superwhitetuna.jpg" />
        <p>A member of the oilfish family and sometimes called White <span class="tuna">Tuna</span> it has been known to cause gastric distress.
            Although fished in the South Pacific, it is banned in many countries including
            Japan due to cased of keriorrhea. Look it up, it's gross!

        <h1>🐟Bluefin Tuna</h1>
        <h3>Maguro</h3>
        <img src="http://japan555.com/prepare/Sushi%20top%2010/Maguro%20No%20Akami1.jpg" />
        <p>Famous for being expensive, Bluefin <span class="tuna">Tuna</span> are large and live up to forty years.
            Mostly fished near Canada in the Pacific, populations are dwindling and 
            it is no longer sustainable, that's why I don't eat it anymore despite being
            deliciously deep red and my favorite.
